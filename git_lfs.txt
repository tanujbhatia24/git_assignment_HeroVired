#GIT LSF implementation steps

    STEP1: #Download and install the Git command line extension. 
        Link: https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v3.6.1/git-lfs-windows-v3.6.1.exe

    STEP2: #Once downloaded and installed, set up Git LFS for your user account by running: "You only need to run this once per user account."
        Run: git lfs install "This sets up Git LFS for your system."


    STEP3: #In each Git repository where you want to use Git LFS, select the file types you'd like Git LFS to manage (or directly edit your .gitattributes). 
    #You can configure additional file extensions at anytime.
    #Track Large Files with Git LFS
        Run: git lfs track "*.bin"   # Example for binary files
        Run: git lfs track "*.zip"   # Example for compressed files

    STEP4: #This creates a .gitattributes file that records tracked file types. Commit this .gitattributes file.
        Run: git add .gitattributes

    STEP5: #Just commit and push as you normally would; for instance, if your current branch is named lfs.
        Run: git commit -m "Add design file"
        Run: git push origin lfs

#GIT LSF Validation steps

    STEP1: #To verify that the file is tracked by Git LFS.
        Run: git lfs ls-files

    STEP2: #To see the pointer file inside Git.
        Run: git show HEAD:large_file.bin
